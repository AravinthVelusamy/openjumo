   "body": "Malaria is caused by a parasite spread to humans through the bite of infected mosquitos. If let untreated, it can cause sever complications and death. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions that receive significant amounts of rainfall and maintain warm temperatures year round. Worldwide malaria kills between 700,000 and 1,000,000 people every year. In the 1640's, Europeans used bark from the cinchona tree containing quinine to treat malaria, and in 1820 quinine was first extracted and isolated as an antimalarial drug. In the 20th century, cloroquine&nbsp;and artemisinins were also discovered to be effective at combatting malaria. However despite almost 400 years of innovation and scientific discovery in antimalarial medication, every 45 seconds a child in Africa will die from malaria.[1] &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWho is affected by malaria?&nbsp;\r\nMalaria is a serious problem in parts of South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. South of the Sahara in Africa, the most common mosquito is an incredibly effective carrier of malaria. Pregnant women and children are the biggest groups targeted. 90% of annual deaths from malaria occur in Africa, and 70% of deaths occurring in children under 5.[2] With 50% of the world's population at risk for infection, an estimate $12,000,000,000 is spent per year on costs related to malaria such as medicine, hospital visits, and funeral costs.[3] &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;Why has malaria only been eradicated in parts of the world?&nbsp;\r\nIn the United States, Malaria has been eradicated since the 1950's. Barriers preventing eradication in areas with high infection, like Africa, include political instability and extreme poverty.   &nbsp;\r\n\r\nPolitical Instability: In countries plagued by war and political turmoil, ruling parties may be resistant to receiving foreign aid, even if that aid comes in the form of mosquito nets or antimalarial drugs. &nbsp;While key prevention techniques, such as sleeping under mosquito nets treated with pesticide, and treatment options are well known, areas with political instability are often unable to successfully implement strategies to curb malaria infection. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nPoverty: Many citizens living in areas with high risk of infection are unable to afford medication. In countries where families may live on less than $2 a day, even the seemingly negligible cost of $5 for a mosquito net that will save lives is unimaginable. Anti-malaria medication may cost even more than nets. While medication is often free of charge in public health clinics, estimates indicate that 60% of malaria patients in Sub-Saharan Africa buy their medication from the private sector.[4] Patients may be unable to take the work off necessary to travel to a health clinic, especially if they live in isolated, rural areas. Even if patients are able to receive treatment, 65% of malaria cases are treated without a diagnostic test, paving way for drug resistance.[5]&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile The World Health Organization estimates an increase from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in international funding for malaria control between 2009 and 2010, this number still falls short of the $6 billion needed for worldwide malaria control.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;",
