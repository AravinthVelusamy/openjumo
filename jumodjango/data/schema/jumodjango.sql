If let untreated, it can cause severe complications and death. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions that receive significant amounts of rainfall and maintain warm temperatures year-round. Worldwide, malaria kills between 700,000 and 1,000,000 people every year.  In the 1640s, Europeans used bark from the cinchona tree containing quinine to treat malaria, and in 1820 quinine was first extracted and isolated as an antimalarial drug. In the 20th century, cloroquine&nbsp;and artemisinins were also discovered to be effective at combatting malaria. However despite almost 400 years of innovation and scientific discovery in antimalarial medication, every 45 seconds a child in Africa will die from malaria. Who is affected by malaria? Malaria is a serious problem in parts of South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the most common mosquito is an incredibly effective carrier of malaria. Pregnant women and children are the biggest groups targeted; 90 percent of annual deaths from malaria occur in Africa, and 70 percent of deaths occurring in children under 5. With 50 percent of the world\'s population at risk for infection, an estimate $12,000,000,000 is spent per year on costs related to malaria such as medicine, hospital visits, and funeral costs.  Why has malaria only been eradicated in parts of the world? In the United States, malaria has been eradicated since the 1950s. Barriers preventing eradication in areas with high infection, like Africa, include political instability, extreme poverty, and adoption of anti-malaria strategies.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPoverty: Many citizens living in areas with high risk of infection are unable to afford medication. In countries where families may live on less than $2 a day, even the seemingly negligible cost of $5 for a mosquito net that will save lives is difficult to afford. Anti-malaria medication may cost even more than nets. While medication is often free of charge in public health clinics, estimates indicate that 60% of malaria patients in Sub-Saharan Africa buy their medication from the private sector. Patients may be unable to take the work off necessary to travel to a health clinic, especially if they live in isolated, rural areas. Even if patients are able to receive treatment, 65% of malaria cases are treated without a diagnostic test, paving way for drug resistance.\r\nAdoption and use of mosquito nets: &nbsp;Actual adoption and use of mosquito nets is a barrier often faced by aid organizations. Data shows that nearly half of Africans who have access to nets refuse to sleep under them. This may be partly due to the limits of the ventilation provided by the nets, which is a challenge in the hot and humid environments where malaria thrives. Aid groups debate the most effective ways to distribute nets and ensure their appropriate use.&nbsp;\r\nPolitical Instability: In countries plagued by war and political turmoil, ruling parties may be resistant to receiving foreign aid, even if that aid comes in the form of mosquito nets or antimalarial drugs.&nbsp; While key prevention techniques, such as sleeping under mosquito nets treated with pesticide, and treatment options are well known, areas with political instability are often unable to successfully implement strategies to curb malaria infection.\r\n\r\nWhile The World Health Organization estimates an increase from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in international funding for malaria control between 2009 and 2010, this number still falls short of the $6 billion needed for worldwide malaria control.','<p>Malaria is caused by a parasite spread to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes.

In the past 30 years, obesity rates have more than doubled while childhood obesity rates have tripled, with over 17% of children now considered obese. Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, asthma, and coronary heart disease. 9.1 percent of America\'s annual health care spending, or $147,000,000,000, is spent on obesity-related treatment.  The root causes of obesity lie in interlocking systems of economic inequality, lack of access to healthcare, and lack of education. These inequalities support the two biggest contributors to obesity: lack of proper nutrition and lack of exercise. Lack of Proper Nutrition&nbsp;  Inadequate nutrition in the U.S. has two main components: lack of access to healthy food and lack of accountability on the part of the food industry. As more Americans move to urban environments, many live in areas without access to community gardens, farmer\'s markets, or other sources of fresh produce. Between traveling longer distances to procure fresh food or using convenience stores and fast-food chains with little fresh produce or locally-sourced whole foods, many are influenced by economic and time constraints to choose the latter. More than 55 million children are enrolled in public schools, where the advertising and sale of sugary soft drinks, candy, and other high caloric foods is rampant. In addition, more than 12 million children participate in some form of daycare outside the home, where licensing regulations around healthy food are often relaxed.  Food today is engineered to be grown quickly, shipped long distances, and stocked on shelves for extended periods of time; this mean less fresh produce and whole foods, and more processed foods packed with preservatives. In addition, many foods full of high-fructose corn syrup and other processed ingredients are able to apply \"healthy\" or \"organic\" labels, which may mislead consumers.  Government may recommend one set of eating habits, but government policies may promote another entirely. A 2010 article in The New York Times showed the misalignment between federal recommendations for the number of servings of protein per day including meat and dairy (6 servings, compared to 9 of fruits and vegetables and 11 of whole grains) and the percentage of federal subsidies for food production (73.8 percent for meat and dairy compared to 13.23 percent for grains). Lack of Exercise Many families live in neighborhoods where they are unable to walk to school, parks, community events, or grocery stores. This promotes a culture in which families increasingly rely on cars for transportation, forgoing a healthy walk for a 5-minute drive. Moreso than ever, the American working life involves sitting at a desk for up to 10 hours a day. A sedentary working life combined with a dependence on cars for transportation and the amount of time spent walking or engaging in exercise on a daily basis has quickly become negligible. On average, children spend 7.5 hours a day devoted to media, including computers and television. Many children also receive little to no physical exercise at school.

Today, numerous governmental and NGO forces are working across the globe to ensure equality for women. Here are a few of the sectors they\'re working in:  Access to Education 130 million global youth are currently without education. Of these, 70 percent are girls. Girls may be excluded from primary, secondary, and higher education for various reasons including cultural or religious attitudes towards women and extreme poverty. Expending resources on educating girls is also often seen as a wasteful investment since girls may be married as young as 15 in many developing regions.  However studies show that women with an extra year of primary school will make 10-20 percent higher wages, and an extra year of secondary school correlates to a wage increase of 15-25 percent. Studies also show that women tend to invest 90 percent of their income back into their families and communities, meaning that the benefits of continued enrollment for girls are lasting and community-wide.  Health and Reproductive Rights Lack of affordable, accessible healthcare is one of the most pervasive problems facing women around the globe. Especially in rural, isolated areas, many women are forced to go without adequate medical assistance. When it comes to reproductive care, this can be deadly.  More than 600,000 women die annually during pregnancy and childbirth. Of the 15 million adolescents age 15 - 19 who give birth every year, 60,000 will die in the course of their pregnancy or childbirth, making pregnancy the leading cause of death for adolescent females. An additional 4.4 million girls age 15 - 19 will receive unsafe abortions annually. In Western Europe the chances of dying from in childbirth are 1 in 3,200, in sub-Saharan Africa, they\'re 1 in 13.  Violence Against Women and Girls In many developed and developing areas of the world women\'s safety is continually threatened by domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of violence. In developing countries the risk can be especially high due to a lack of legal enforcement or cultural strictures prohibiting violence against women. One third of countries have no official laws against domestic violence. In 17 of 41 countries interviewed by the UN, a quarter or more of men believe it is acceptable for a man to beat his wife. Areas with tolerant attitudes towards violence against women may also be less likely to enact legislation against practices like marital rape or female genital mutilation/cutting.  Attitudes against women often intersect with other forms of cultural, social, economic, and racial oppression to further legitimize violence. Women working as domestic workers, for instance, face disproportionately high instances of violence and sexual harassment. While rape and sexual violence have historically been used as weapons in warfare, it wasn\'t until 1998 that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda dictated that rape could constitute genocide under international law. Until the 2001 International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, rape was not included in the definition of crimes against humanity. &nbsp;\r\nPolitical and Economic Access Women without opportunities for income generation are unable to participate fully in their communities, leaving them vulnerable to further social exclusion and marginalization. On average, women perform 66% of the world\'s work and produce 50% of the world\'s food, yet they earn only 10% of the world\'s income and own 1% of the world\'s land. Inheritance and land rights remain obscure for many women in the developing world. Without the economic and social resources to run and work in sustainable business environments, the number of women living in poverty will continue to rise.&nbsp;\r\nA lack of political access still plagues many women in the developing world as well, further contributing to their marginalization. Even in developed regions, women have achieved only as high as 30 percent of all ministerial positions in a country, and nowhere in the world have women achieved that percentage of representation in a parliament.

In Western Europe the chances of dying from in childbirth are 1 in 3,200, in sub-Saharan Africa, they\'re 1 in 13. <br /><br /> <em>Violence Against Women and Girls</em><br /><br /> In many developed and developing areas of the world women\'s safety is continually threatened by domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of violence. In developing countries the risk can be especially high due to a lack of legal enforcement or cultural strictures prohibiting violence against women. One third of countries have no official laws against domestic violence. In 17 of 41 countries interviewed by the UN, a quarter or more of men believe it is acceptable for a man to beat his wife. Areas with tolerant attitudes towards violence against women may also be less likely to enact legislation against practices like marital rape or female genital mutilation/cutting. <br /><br /> Attitudes against women often intersect with other forms of cultural, social, economic, and racial oppression to further legitimize violence. Women working as domestic workers, for instance, face disproportionately high instances of violence and sexual harassment. While rape and sexual violence have historically been used as weapons in warfare, it wasn\'t until 1998 that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda dictated that rape could constitute genocide under international law. Until the 2001 International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, rape was not included in the definition of crimes against humanity. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Political and Economic Access</em><br /><br /> Women without opportunities for income generation are unable to participate fully in their communities, leaving them vulnerable to further social exclusion and marginalization. On average, women perform 66% of the world\'s work and produce 50% of the world\'s food, yet they earn only 10% of the world\'s income and own 1% of the world\'s land. Inheritance and land rights remain obscure for many women in the developing world. Without the economic and social resources to run and work in sustainable business environments, the number of women living in poverty will continue to rise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A lack of political access still plagues many women in the developing world as well, further contributing to their marginalization. Even in developed regions, women have achieved only as high as 30 percent of all ministerial positions in a country, and nowhere in the world have women achieved that percentage of representation in a parliament. Lack of adequate political access, whether it\'s representation in government or the ability to vote, undermines political and social movements towards equality for women.</p>'),(28676,176,21,'center',1,'How is the problem being addressed?','\r\n Microenterprise: Recently, social sector solutions for women in developing countries have focused on creating equal economic access through job training, microfinance, and microenterprises.

As stated before, shelters themselves can lead to further hardship and trauma, and some consider investments in shelters to be a diversion from long-term solutions. Non-profit organizations and government programs tasked with bringing people out of homelessness do so through a mix of addressing individual causes such as substance abuse, illness, and domestic violence, and directly providing short- and long-term housing. A recent trend in addressing homelessness favors the latter-a \"Housing First\" approach. Those who favor this approach maintain that addressing individual causes of homelessness becomes much more feasible once the individual returns to the stability of a permanent home. Rather than treating specific causes, this approach first places homeless people into housing as quickly as possible and then addresses individual conditions and circumstances. The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the agency that is tasked with coordinating the federal response to homelessness across all federal agencies, has endorsed Housing First as a best practice and top level policy recommendation. The U.S. government has to date funded more than 70,000 Housing First units since 2001. Organizations that address homelessness do so through material assistance and through policy advocacy that calls on the U.S. government to provide increased funding and attention to the plight of the homeless. Examples are National Coalition for the Homeless, National Alliance to End Homelessness, and National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. Solving homelessness Solutions to preventing homelessness and stemming its tide rest squarely on addressing the shortage of affordable housing in the United States. Addressing this problem largely rests on government policy and funding, channeled primarily through the U.S. Department on Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD considers the expansion of affordable housing to be at the core of its mission, and attempts to do so through a number of programs.\r\n\r\nGrants to state and local governments to build low-income housing\r\nGrants to non-profits to purchase home sites and establish sweat equity-based homeownership programs\r\nFunding for communities to reclaim and revitalize vacant properties and blighted neighborhoods\r\n\r\nIn addition to these programs, public housing-government-owned, subsidized housing offered to eligible low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities at affordable rent prices-is administered by HUD and also plays a major role in preventing homelessness. HUD estimates that 1.2 million households currently live in public rental housing. Maintaining and increasing funding for public housing is a major point of advocacy for organizations devoted to low income housing, like the National Low Income Housing Coalition. While many organizations work to advocate increased funding and programs, some organizations work directly to provide affordable housing to poor and low-income people. One example is Habitat for Humanity, an organization that directly builds affordable housing for those in need.

Some of the biggest challenges for American women today include workplace discrimination, access to reproductive health, and sexual violence.&nbsp; Workplace Discrimination The Equal Pay Act of 1963 outlawed the practice of sex-based wage discrimination, after which employers were no longer able to promote or base pay on gender. Two years later, President Eisenhower formed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has since served a vital role in passing legislation to end workplace discrimination, including sex-selective advertising and discrimination against pregnant employees. Women today constitute roughly half of the workforce and are equal, if not primary, breadwinners in four out of ten families.But sex-based wage gaps and institutionalized attitudes that devalue women&rsquo;s contributions to the workforce still persist. When the Equal Pay Act was passed, women were making an average of 59 cents for every dollar paid to men. In 2009, women&rsquo;s median annual paychecks showed a wage discrepancy of 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. This means, on average, the wage gap has closed less than half a penny per year since 1963.In addition, jobs with higher percentages of female workers often pay less than jobs with lower percentages of female workers, regardless of the education levels needed to attain those positions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that Police and Sheriff Patrol Officers, only an estimated 13% of which are female, make a mean annual wage of $55,620. In the predominantly female-staffed Home Health Aid field however, workers can expect a mean annual wage of $21,760.Reproductive RightsThe issue of reproductive rights has long been a cornerstone of the U.S. feminist movement. Reproductive rights include access to quality sexual and reproductive health care and the ability to freely make reproduction-related decisions. It includes issues like birth control and education about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases.A woman&rsquo;s right to abortion has been one of the most contested issues within women&rsquo;s rights.&nbsp; In 1973 the Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, dictated that a woman&rsquo;s decision to obtain a therapeutic abortion should be protected under the law. Since 1973, there have been numerous state and federal pushes to repeal this right, as well as proposals to remove federal funding from health care providers that offer abortion services. &nbsp;Some consider these bills to be a direct attack on providers like Planned Parenthood, a nation-wide health care provider operating more than 800 health centers across the U.S. and serving 3 million men and women a year.Rape and Sexual Assault1 out of every 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime.&nbsp; But despite the high prevalence of rape and sexual assault in the U.S., and factoring in high instances of unreported rapes (estimates indicate less than half of all cases are reported), the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network notes that only 6% of rapists will ever spend a day in jail.Low instances of reporting can be contributed to stigma and cultural mores that punish women for taking action against their attackers. Victim blaming is when a sexual assault survivor is accused, by virtue of their dress, attitude, job, alcohol consumption, and numerous other factors, to have invited or instigated the events that led to their sexual assault. In court cases victim blaming is also used to insinuate that the victim is unable to provide accurate testimony.In addition, in the United States two-thirds of all rape victims and 93% of juvenile rape victims know their attacker, increasing the likelihood of emotional and psychological force and date rape.\r\n&nbsp;','<p>Despite gains in the legal protection of gender equality under U.S. law and decades of shifts in cultural mores regarding women&rsquo;s sexuality, ability, and intelligence, women in the U.S. still face inequality and prejudice in the workplace, within family life, and even in courts of law. Some of the biggest challenges for American women today include workplace discrimination, access to reproductive health, and sexual violence.&nbsp;<br /><br /> <em>Workplace Discrimination<br /></em> The Equal Pay Act of 1963 outlawed the practice of sex-based wage discrimination, after which employers were no longer able to promote or base pay on gender. Two years later, President Eisenhower formed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has since served a vital role in passing legislation to end workplace discrimination, including sex-selective advertising and discrimination against pregnant employees. Women today constitute roughly half of the workforce and are equal, if not primary, breadwinners in four out of ten families.<br /><br />But sex-based wage gaps and institutionalized attitudes that devalue women&rsquo;s contributions to the workforce still persist. When the Equal Pay Act was passed, women were making an average of 59 cents for every dollar paid to men. In 2009, women&rsquo;s median annual paychecks showed a wage discrepancy of 77 cents for every dollar paid to men.

Recent gains include the repeal of the military\'s \"Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell\" policy regarding sexual orientation and the Obama administration\'s decision to no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as solely between a man and woman. Despite these gains, however, legal protection for LGBT rights is still absent in many parts of the U.S.\r\nSome of the most prevalent issues affecting LGBT citizens today include: Bullying In 2010, a rash of teen suicides shocked the nation. Two of the victims were as young as 13 and all had faced sexual orientation-related bullying at school. LGBT youth are two to three times more likely to be harassed in school than their heterosexual peers, particularly if they attend school in rural areas. Intolerance and harassment is inflicted on many LGBT students. Only 17 states include legislation that specifically deals with bullying and harassment based on sexual orientation, fewer still include laws prohibiting bullying and harassment based on gender orientation or cyber bullying.  Marriage Equality  While certain partner-rights are established in domestic partnerships, without marriage many LGBT couples are incapable of fully protecting their families and relationships. Rights and protection guaranteed to heterosexual married couples include:\r\n\r\nHospital visitation rights\r\nFamily leave from work to care for an ill spouse\r\nTax breaks\r\nHealth insurance coverage through spouse\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, unmarried couples are also prohibited from jointly applying for adoption. Similar laws exist in Arkansas and same-sex couples are expressly forbidden to adopt in Utah and Mississippi. To date, only six states in the U.S. plus the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage. Fifteen other states recognize same sex domestic partnerships. Transgender discrimination Despite gains in acceptance and legal equality of LGBT citizens, transgender citizens continue to face hostility within the U.S. The experiences undergone by transgender people applying for work, changing gender of official documents, and dealing with harassment vary. However common themes include discrimination and violence. As of 2004, only 103 employers had employment policies that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity and expression. Transgender people who choose to transition genders are especially vulnerable to workplace discrimination and hostility. Transgender people are also more vulnerable to violent crime.

Human trafficking supplies men, women and children for the 21st-century\'s rapidly growing slave trade. It is estimated that more than 14,500 slaves are trafficked into the United States annually. &nbsp;Sex Trafficking in the U.S.\r\nSexual trafficking remains a very real problem in the United States. Estimates indicate that up to 100,000 children may be working in the commercial sex industry. The estimated age of recruitment in domestic networks is 12-14. These minors may come from Asian or Latino trafficking networks, but many of them are also U.S. citizens who have run away from dangerous home environments where they become vulnerable to trafficking and forced sex work.Traffickers will use telephone chat lines and chat rooms, clubs, and popular afterschool hangouts to recruit minors. Sex traffickers also focus on people with histories of emotional and physical abuse or alcohol and substance addiction problems. These people are vulnerable to tactics traffickers use to control their victims such as threats, extortion, and violence. Sexual trafficking occurs across different venues within the wider commercial sex industry. Residential brothels, strip clubs, and massage parlors may all use victims of sexual trafficking. Within domestic networks, victims are forced to perform sexual acts on an average of 7 to 15 men per day. While they may make up to $1,000 in a single night, their pimps and traffickers will often take all of this money. &nbsp;Labor Exploitation in the U.S.&nbsp;\r\nElsewhere in the U.S., employers use trafficking and debt bondage to maintain control over thousands of migrant farm, domestic, and factory workers across the country. Debt bondage refers to a situation in which a worker accepts services like food, clothes, shelter, or travel costs from their employer, only to be informed that by accepting the services, they have incurred a debt they must pay off, often for much more than the actual costs of the services. The worker is forced to use their labor to repay the debt. As time goes on, the employer will continue to add money to the worker\'s debts. Employers use violence, intimidation, and threats of legal action against the worker to keep them from reporting these unfair working conditions. In other forms of labor exploitation workers may be paid wages far below the legal minimum, forced to work inhumane hours in unsafe conditions, or forced to continue working for an abusive employer because they fear violence or legal action if they leave. Since agricultural, domestic, and factory work is often left undocumented and unexamined, many U.S. citizens remain unaware when their clothes or fresh produce are products of human trafficking and slave labor. In fact, almost 11% of people in forced labor situations as a result of trafficking can be found in industrialized countries. Some farm workers in the U.S. are as young as five or six years old. Victims of both sex trafficking and forced labor are often afraid to come forward, fearing prosecution for prostitution or illegal immigration and the loss of their only viable source of income. Workers who are in the country illegally may also be excluded from laws used to protect worker\'s rights.','<p>Human trafficking is the illegal trade of human beings for the purposes of labor or sexual exploitation through means of force, fraud, or coercion.
